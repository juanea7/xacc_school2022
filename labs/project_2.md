# Project 2 Description

- Opportunity for you to apply knowledge from this course and work on a “real” problem with additional support from instructors

- Choose your own project
  
  - Building a design from the Vitis open-source libraries

- Not a competition

- Try to collaborate in teams of 2
  
  - Are your colleagues attending and do you want to work together?
  
  - Start a discussion on Slack

- Breakout rooms will be created to facilitate team discussions

## Project work suggestions

- Plan a project you can cover in the available time
  
  - Plan smaller milestones

- Be aware of build and debug times

  - Allow at least 2 hours build time for full xclbin (hardware) generation

   - Allow at least 30 minutes for Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) generation

   - Use Emulation-HW and run HW build overnight

- Your current research may not be the most appropriate example
  
  - For instance, AI/ML application or OpenCL kernel

- Try to use Vitis Accelerated Libraries

  - Explore a domain you are familiar with

  - Vision is a good starting point
  
  - Start with one function from an L2 kernel and extend

- Explore XRT native API

- Use GitHub to host your project!


## Project Work Support

- Instructors will try to help and give general guidance

  - Unlikely to be able to spend a lot of time on any one project

- 30 minutes discuss on Thursday and Friday
  
  - Give an update

- Post general issues in the Slack channel
  
  - For everyone’s benefit
  
  - You are encouraged to reply to each other!

- Roundtable – Friday afternoon
